# DL augmentation

DL augmentation is the package for neural network-assisted atomic electron tomography.
DL augmentation package has two parts; data generator codes (written by matlab) & deep learning codes (written by python, pytorch package).

For the detail, please see the paper: J. Lee, C. Jeong and Y. Yang, “Single-atom level determination of 3-dimensional surface atomic structure via neural network-assisted atomic electron tomography”, Nature Communications (2021).


## Data generator for DLaugmentation (matlab)
DL data generator consists of generating input/target data.

To use data generator, please download the GENFIRE package.
