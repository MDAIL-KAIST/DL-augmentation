# DL augmentation

DL augmentation is the package for neural network-assisted atomic electron tomography.
DL augmentation package has two parts; data generator codes (written by matlab) & deep learning codes (written by python, pytorch package).

For detail, see the paper: J. Lee, C. Jeong and Y. Yang, “Single-atom level determination of 3-dimensional surface atomic structure via neural network-assisted atomic electron tomography”, Nature Communications (2021).
